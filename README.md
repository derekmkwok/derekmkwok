## Hi, I'm Derek!

I'm a self taught software engineer with 4 years of professional experience in full stack development. I previously had some projects publicly displayed on my GitHub, but they are no longer a good representation of my current coding ability and have been set to private.

### Experience

- Founding Software Engineer at Quip Medical
- Full Stack Software Developer at Geotab
- Full Stack Software Developer at Pathcore
