## Hi, I'm Derek!

I'm a software engineer with 5 years of professional experience in full stack development and 8 years of experience in engineering/technical roles. I previously had some projects publicly displayed on my GitHub, but they are no longer a good representation of my current coding ability and have been set to private.

### Experience

- Software Engineer at eBay
- Founding Software Engineer at Quip Medical
- Full Stack Software Developer at Geotab
- Full Stack Software Developer at Pathcore
